# 🌦 Weather Channel – Live Weather Poster

This website fetches **live weather data** using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Depending on the current weather, the app displays a corresponding visual theme — like **sunny**, **cloudy**, **rainy**, or **snowy**.

## 🌀 What It Does

- Connects to OpenWeatherMap API in real time  
- Detects your current weather using a city name or location  
- Displays a weather-themed poster based on conditions:
  - ☀️ Sunny  
  - ☁️ Cloudy  
  - 🌧 Rainy  
  - ❄️ Snowy

Basically, a cute visual "poster" of what's going on outside — like a vibe check, but weather-style.

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- OpenWeatherMap API  
- Basic DOM manipulation and condition-based theming
